# Menu-Driven-In-C-
This C program manages a to-do list.  It presents a menu with options to add, list, mark as complete, delete, save, and load tasks.  Tasks are stored with descriptions and completion status.  The program uses a structured approach with functions for each menu option, improving code organization.
