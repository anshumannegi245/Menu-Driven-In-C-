Explanation and How to Compile/Run:

Includes:

stdio.h: Provides standard input/output functions like printf and scanf.
stdlib.h: Provides general utility functions (not strictly needed for this basic example, but good practice to include if you might use functions like exit() later).
main() function:

The heart of the program.

Variables:
choice: Stores the user's menu selection (integer).
num1, num2: Store the two numbers the user will input (floats for potential decimal values).
result: Stores the result of the calculation (float).

do...while loop:
This loop ensures the menu is displayed and the program continues to run until the user chooses to exit (choice 5).
Menu Display:

printf is used to display the menu options to the user

User Input:
scanf reads the user's choice and stores it in the choice variable

switch statement:
This controls the program flow based on the user's choice.
Each case corresponds to a menu option.
The code within each case performs the appropriate calculation.
Important: The break statement at the end of each case is crucial. It prevents the code from "falling through" to the next case.
default: Handles invalid choices (anything other than 1-5).

Calculations:
The code within each case performs the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
Division by Zero Check:

In the division case, there's a check to prevent division by zero, which would cause an error.
Output:

printf displays the result of the calculation, formatted to two decimal places (%.2f).
Exit Condition:
When the user chooses option 5, the do...while loop terminates, and the program ends.
